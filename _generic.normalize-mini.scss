/**
 * A tiny subset of the Predix UI normalize Sass module that is meant for use
 * when building components that don't need a ton of resets. These styles are
 * all scope to `:host` so they will work inside the Shadow DOM of a component
 * that imports them.
 *
 * Only does the following
 * 1. Sets the component text color based on $inuit-base-text-color.
 * 2. Sets the component text line-height based on $inuit-base-line-height and
 *    $inuit-base-font-size.
 * 3. Prevent certain mobile browsers from automatically zooming fonts.
 * 4. Fonts on OSX will look more consistent with other systems that do not
 *    render text using sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
 *
 * Some rules based on normalize.css v3.0.2 | MIT License | git.io/normalize
